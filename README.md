## Quick Start

In order to run this application, you'll first need to install [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/) and create a database on [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/basics/create-database).  Once you've set those up, you're good to go!

### Directions:
#### From your command line:
- run ```redis-server``` to start your Redis instance.

### From your source-code editor:
1. Create a ```.env ``` file in your ```root``` directory.
2. Inside your ```.env```, add 

    ```MONGO_URI=<your mongo link here>```
3. ``` npm install ``` dependencies.
4. Run ``` npm run dev ``` and you're good to go!
